    "## 🚀 Introduction: The Imperative of Error Mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era, quantum computers are powerful but fundamentally flawed. When you run a circuit, the result, $x_{noisy}$, is distorted by physical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the long-term solution is Quantum Error Correction (QEC), the overhead is too great for current hardware. Instead, we use **Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM)**, which is algorithmic post-processing and data-driven techniques to estimate the ideal expectation value ($\\hat{x}_i$) from noisy measurement data ($x_n$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:** Build a post-processing function $f_\\theta$ (an AI model) that predicts the ideal result $x_{ideal}$ from noisy data: \n",
    "$$x_{ideal} \\approx f_\\theta(x_{noisy}, \\text{Circuit Features})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To succeed, your AI model must understand the underlying quantum mechanical processes that generate the noise data."

    "## 1.1 The Physical Realization: Superconducting Transmons\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively mitigate errors, one must first understand the physical origin of quantum operations. A qubit is not a digital bit; it is an analog microwave resonator. The primary platform for the competition's data is the **superconducting transmon qubit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Harmonic to Anharmonic Oscillators\n",
    "A standard LC circuit behaves as a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator with equally spaced energy levels.\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_{LC} = \\hbar \\omega_r \\left( \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{a} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equal spacing is a problem: a control pulse intended to drive the $|0\\rangle \\to |1\\rangle$ transition would *also* drive the $|1\\rangle \\to |2\\rangle$ transition, preventing us from isolating the computational subspace $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is the **Josephson Junction (JJ)**, which acts as a non-linear inductor, introducing an **anharmonicity ($\\alpha$)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transmon Hamiltonian is approximately:\n",
    "$$\\hat{H} \\approx 4E_C (\\hat{n} - n_g)^2 - E_J \\cos(\\hat{\\phi})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This non-linearity makes the energy levels unequal, allowing us to uniquely address the $|0\\rangle \\to |1\\rangle$ transition ($\\omega_{01}$) without exciting the $|1\\rangle \\to |2\\rangle$ transition ($\\omega_{12}$), provided $\\omega_{12} \\approx \\omega_{01} + \\alpha$ where $\\alpha$ is typically $-300$ to $-350$ MHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leakage Errors\n",
    "Despite the anharmonicity, errors occur. If a control pulse is too short in time, its spectral width in frequency becomes broad (due to the Fourier limit). If this spectral width overlaps with $\\omega_{12}$, the qubit can transition to the non-computational $|2\\rangle$ state. This is known as **leakage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insight for AI:** Leakage is a non-Clifford, non-unital error that violates the two-level assumption of many standard QEM techniques like Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). If the dataset includes higher-energy occupation probabilities, a leakage-aware model may be required."

    "### Rabi Oscillations\n",
    "To implement an $X$-gate ($180^\\circ$ rotation), a microwave drive field is applied. Think of this as pushing a child on a swing at the resonant frequency. Continuous pushing causes the state to oscillate between $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ (Rabi oscillation).\n",
    "\n",
