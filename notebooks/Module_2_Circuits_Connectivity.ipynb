    "# Module 2: Circuits and Connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum circuit is a sequence of gates acting on a register of qubits. While single-qubit physics is rich, the true complexity—and the primary source of error—arises from multi-qubit interactions and the constraints of the physical hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 The \"Killer\" Gate: Cross-Resonance (CR)\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-qubit gates are fast and accurate (99.9%). The problem lies in the entangling gates (2-qubit gates).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Physics:** IBM hardware uses the **Cross-Resonance (CR)** effect. We drive **Qubit 0 (Control)** at the frequency of **Qubit 1 (Target)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mechanism:** Because the qubits are coupled, driving $Q_c$ at $\\omega_t$ induces a driven oscillation on $Q_t$. Crucially, the *strength* and *sign* of this drive depend on the state of $Q_c$ ($|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The effective Hamiltonian is approximately:\n",
    "$$H_{CR} \\approx ZX = \\sigma_z^{(c)} \\otimes \\sigma_x^{(t)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Cost:**\n",
    "* **Slow:** CR gates are slow (300–600 ns) compared to single-qubit gates (30–60 ns). This exposes qubits to significant decoherence ($T_1/T_2$).\n",
    "* **Leaky:** The strong drive can cause **crosstalk** (errors on neighbors).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Competition Insight:** In the AQC competition, identifying the number and location of ECR/CNOT gates is the single most predictive feature for total error."

    "## 2.2 Topology and SWAPs\n",
    "\n",
    "Qubits are not fully connected; they are laid out in a grid, often a **Heavy-Hex lattice**. You cannot entangle Qubit 0 and Qubit 10 directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SWAP Gate:** To interact distant qubits, the compiler inserts SWAP gates to physically move the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Cost of Distance:**\n",
    "$$1 \\text{ SWAP} = 3 \\text{ CNOTs}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This triples the error!. An AI model should ideally take the **distance matrix** of the device topology as an input. A CNOT between neighbors has error $\\epsilon$; a CNOT between distant qubits has error $\\approx 3 \\times \\text{distance} \\times \\epsilon$."
